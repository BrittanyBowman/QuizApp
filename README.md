Quizzard:

Group project created to allow teachers and employers to create various quizzing applications such as surveys, multiple choice, essay type and other quizzes. When the user takes the test, the teacher/employer are both emailed the results of the test, complete with grades.
Brittany's main goal was to create front end page layouts with details, achieve authentication and learn MongoDB for our backend.
